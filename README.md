# albert-plugin-mediaremote

## Features

- Control playback of active players with 'Play', 'Pause', 'Next', 'Previous' items.
- Items match player name and localized and english titles.

## Platforms

- macOS (Private MediaRemote.framework)
- Freedesktop (MPRIS DBus API)

## Limitations

On macOS only one player at a time is recognized as playing application. That's the one you would
expect to be controlled by the media keys.
